- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Barrymore-Pool-Attendant
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ... Freesoftware, generally better than any paid software by comparison. Devs, i do, if i like your work, DONATE.com, 
- Devs need my thanks, but, probably get an attic full of likes and tyvm, it don't pay the bills. My opinion is what it is for myself. Donations if can afford it, 
- if not got dollar, uk gbp, then it just gets put on the waiting list. Swear to god mate, trust mate.. Lol. always donate eventually....
-  8 months down the fucking line, not a charitable guy, but, this is 1 important, erm, policy? for me, aint paying water rates, but devs (actually programmers, 
-  see RELATE and believe in the cause, its close to my heart, nostalgia innit? C64/Amiga 500/DOS 5/6 -Qbasic- Was my starting point into computers Loved Basic BASIC.. ..
-  best part, books or old mags 90% of the time, i found, were full of Basic programs, BASIC u realise.. varied between systems, e.g AMSTRAD CPC... APPLE? ACORN/BBC MICRO ACORN?? ARCHAMEDIES, TURNIP 650... .. Making shit up now, TURNIP is a lie, fake news... Apple was it not like rebrand of MAC, or mebe APPLE was b4 macintosh.. YHou know if you know.....
-   fuck it im off getting a brew... lmao) To bring it back on track im saying that my coding from a magazine or library book, STANDARD as a kid.. 
-   Respect i pay you guys and not my water rates (can't cut me off) n fuck TV licence, just move a lot, and what? Forums, Discord i've seen this, not just being a twat, So many lizards, im sure you got names like Cuntfuck or something? 
-   Its these ppl, i read and imagine or in fact, im stelling facts, these guys... start following developers, creeping, asking shit thats weird..
-   Some are obnoxious to newcomers, etc etc. Saying devs or whoever they can brown nose, try to, manipulate.. they best thing since sliced bread! lol and are the most billy big bollox at 10 Cls 20 Goto 10. These types of lurkers like to inform every man and his dog they 100 % have donated also, loads of money, they say. Lies, but, maybe you won't check? Salty rant? Not losing any sleep over it, haha cunts or not, not a blip on my radar.
-   Not arsed but i'ts, an observation, maybe it's my imagination? but, not like its my problem? TOO OLD mateys, if, you relate then cool! connection made..
-   Salty only if i gave a shit. Lol, i like chatting bubbles you may think? Again you guys do you and i'll do me. cus barely keep myself in check, no time for idiots.. 
-   Got stories to tell and as no one reads a readme.txt so no chance ne1 got time for readme.md, especially in an empty barron directory, or github profile then i'll put my over thinking down in words, therapy my filthy little toerag, got to go fly a kite.. ciao kids. 
- 
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ... To act my age.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ... Similar likes, dislikes.. Cba so this is TBA
- 
- üì´ How to reach me ... Weirdly not on social, STEAM tho, sort of semi social? so add me if you want, gaming last few yrs has declined 4 myself, but, try if im available or arsed.. ELITE:DANGEROUS was my last game i was into.. HAHA, yep joined a SQUAD... not a fucking hope id get chance to play, had good intentions of being commited....
- but, yep, playing games is not as it once was.. Im dogshite age dulls reactions, got fucking RSI right hand, wrist from mouse usage...
-  Android playstore CASUAL and sedate games these days... Wrist allowing, that is.. Wankers cramp everyones 1st thought, too much wanking, Carpel Tunnel Syndrome, is cock blocking the ability to crack one out n sling some string....
-  
-   handed.. im not. Media addiction, summat i avoided... i suppose, so many issues n no fucking tissues, means, enough on my plate..... Happy days...
